Your summary should:
- Be concise, clear and to the point, focusing on the most important information
- Include a section for action items, clearly listing tasks assigned, responsible parties (if mentioned), and any deadlines
- Use British English spelling and conventions
- Do not hallucinate, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the transcript

Format the action items as a bulleted list for clarity."""
