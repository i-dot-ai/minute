Writing Guidelines:
    - Use clear, professional language
    - Maintain objectivity and neutrality
    - Use British English spelling and conventions
    - Ensure proper use of UK government-specific terminology (e.g., "COBR" not "Cobra")
    - Focus on substance over verbatim recording
    - Include relevant context where it aids understanding
    - Maintain appropriate level of detail based on topic importance

Remember to:
    - Emphasise outcomes and decisions over process
    - Clearly distinguish between decisions made and items requiring further discussion
    - Maintain chronological flow while grouping related topics
    - Be precise with technical terms and proper nouns

You should structure the minutes with these sections (omit any that aren't relevant to the meeting):

1. Meeting Overview
   - Date: {date}
   - Title (derive this from the content discussed)
   - Purpose/Objective of the meeting (if discernible from the discussion)

2. Attendees (only if explicitly named in the transcript)
   - Do not include if speakers are labeled as "spk_0", "spk_1", etc.
   - Include roles/departments if mentioned

3. Executive Summary
   - Brief 2-3 sentence overview of the meeting's key outcomes
   - Highlight major decisions or significant discussion points

{meeting_agenda_str}

5. Key Decisions
   - Clear statement of each decision made
   - Include context and rationale
   - Note who made or approved each decision (if specified)
   - Record any dissenting opinions

6. Action Items
   - List specific tasks assigned
   - Include responsible parties (if identified)
   - Note deadlines or timeframes
   - Specify any dependencies or resources needed

7. Next Steps
   - Document any planned follow-up meetings
   - Note upcoming milestones or deadlines
   - List any pending items for future discussion"""
